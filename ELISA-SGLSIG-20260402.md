## ELISA Space Grade Linux Special Interests Group

The goal of the group is to advance space technology innovation and competitiveness by developing a common Linux distribution that can be used in space applications, ready for the challenges of deep space, often long lifespan robotic or human-based missions. The nature of space missions brings many challenges, from development to deployment there are multiple considerations that need to be considered. Furthermore this group is the initial step towards creating an ecosystem of supported platforms and a community that benefits from them, and also from the open source nature of the project.

# Announcements

## Foundation Update

We are in the process of establishing SGL as a standalone Linux Foundation project and are looking for organizations who would like to be part of that from the start.

If your organization is involved in space systems and you think there could be a fit, we would welcome a short 1:1 conversation to share more about what founding membership looks like and answer any questions. No commitment required at this stage.

If you are interested, please reach out to Ramon Roche at rroche@linuxfoundation.org or feel free to mention it during today's round table.

# Technical Topics

## CI Update

Significant CI improvements since the last meeting. Full documentation at https://sgl.elisa.tech/contribute.html

- **#42** (merged): Added RunsOn named runner configurations for consistent CI runner profiles
- **#41** (merged): Refactored all CI build logic into a single reusable workflow (`build-sgl.yml`). Each target workflow is now ~17 lines instead of ~73, making it trivial to add new build targets. Also added QEMU SpaceROS (ARM64, RISC-V) and x86-64 build targets. Supersedes and closes #32 and #33, based on work by @alenik22.

## Roadmap Discussion

RFC sent to the mailing list today to collect community input on priorities. See the mailing list thread: **[RFC] SGL Technical Roadmap - We need your input**

Looking for feedback on:
1. Features or capabilities that would make SGL useful for your work today
2. Hardware platform priorities
3. User space frameworks or libraries needed
4. Willingness to contribute or maintain specific areas

QEMU fault injection (Radshield collaboration): looking for folks interested in joining a dedicated working session or alternate group call to move this forward.

**Telemetry Capturing**

The group was discussing EDAC/ECC and that brought the topic of capturing telemetry, initially so we can have a public repository of logging that we can query and inform the development, but the conversation forked into live telemetry from production systems, and discussing the implications and possible implementations.

**Virtualization (meta-vert)**

Runtime and Buildtime container support
Health Monitoring support (eBPF?)

## Call for Maintainers

Continuing from last meeting. The PR queue is growing and we need community members willing to take on maintainer roles (PR review, documentation). Merge permissions granted in return.

~~**TODO:**~~
* ~~Add Pedro and Ivan as contributors with maintain permissions on the SGL maintainer team.~~ - done
