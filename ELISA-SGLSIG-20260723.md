## ELISA Space Grade Linux Special Interests Group

The goal of the group is to advance space technology innovation and competitiveness by developing a common Linux distribution that can be used in space applications, ready for the challenges of deep space, often long lifespan robotic or human-based missions. The nature of space missions brings many challenges, from development to deployment there are multiple considerations that need to be considered. Furthermore this group is the initial step towards creating an ecosystem of supported platforms and a community that benefits from them, and also from the open source nature of the project.

# Announcements

## Foundation Update

SGL continues its move toward becoming a standalone Linux Foundation project. Founding member outreach is ongoing and the response remains encouraging.

If your organization is interested in being part of the inaugural group of founding members, now is the time to start that conversation. Founding members will be recognized at launch and benefit from the visibility that comes with it. This is open to organizations of any size, and there is no commitment required to explore the opportunity.

Even if you are just exploring, please reach out to Ramon directly at rroche@linuxfoundation.org. We are happy to have a confidential 1:1 to answer questions and share more about what founding membership involves.

## New Yocto LTS Wrynose

New Kernel, package updates, and the latest meta-virtualization

**TODO**: Rob will add to CI and test with our current infra

# Technical Topics

## Guest Talk: Tuxera - The Physical AI Data Layer for Space Grade Linux Platforms

Guest presentation from Tuxera on embedded data management for spacecraft payloads and vehicles: file systems, flash translation layers, and power-fail resilience.

Presenting:

- Rahn Twitchell, Senior Account Manager, Tuxera (rahn.twitchell@tuxera.com)
- Frank Loweree, Senior Sales Engineer, Tuxera (frank.loweree@tuxera.com)

Talk outline (~25 min plus discussion):

1. Physical AI terminology and where it came from
2. How industrial and automotive are already translating Physical AI into architecture
3. Spacecraft data-layer challenges when AI becomes embodied on payloads and vehicles
4. Solution patterns: resilient embedded storage as an SGL enabling layer
5. Where Tuxera components could fill gaps, and a low-risk integration path

Core assertion for the group: Physical AI makes storage part of the control loop, not just a back-office log destination. The data layer has to be deterministic under power loss, media aging, radiation effects, and constrained downlink.

The six requirements Tuxera puts underneath AI models, autonomous software, and mission operations:

- Preserve mission data across power interruption, watchdog reset, low power modes, and software restart
- Bounded, deterministic behavior for mount, commit, and recovery
- Active media lifecycle management: flash wear, bad blocks, retention, ECC
- Verify and explain: metadata CRCs, audits, logs, provenance
- Fit constrained compute budgets on spacecraft and payload processors
- Integrate with open SGL and stay portable as the platform scales

Proposed discussion questions from the presenters:

- Which classes of data require transactional protection versus best-effort bulk buffering?
- What should be guaranteed after a watchdog reset, power fault, or SEU-related restart?
- Which SGL targets use eMMC/UFS/SSD versus raw NAND or NOR/rad-hardened flash?
- What common use cases would a power-interruption and degraded-media test harness need to cover?
- What assurance artifacts would help integrate SGL with mission criticality or safety certification requirements?

Open question back to the working group: what data-layer guarantees should SGL make visible to payload and vehicle developers?

### Presentation Discussion / Notes



## Roadmap Discussion (continued)

Continuing the roadmap RFC. The thread remains open for additional input.

**Proposals for Roadmap:**
* Minimal System Layer, stripped down and usable out of the box
  * Documenting what's in the build, and why.
  * Run a hello world example, and trace down. Workload Tracing for the Linux Kernel (covers full kernel + userspace view)
    * See https://www.kernel.org/doc/html//v6.9/admin-guide/workload-tracing.html
    * [ELISA Subsystem trace research](https://github.com/elisa-tech/ELISA-White-Papers/blob/master/Processes/Discovering_Linux_kernel_subsystems_used_by_a_workload.md)
  * Aerospace is working a minimal practice activity with docs, [background here on end user goals](https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/issues/168#issuecomment-4183867886)
* Stress and do analysis on partitions on workloads, with [stress-ng](https://github.com/ColinIanKing/stress-ng)
* CI all the way to hardware, make sure we are verifying hardware runs builds
* cFS info: https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/blob/main/demos/docs/Build-cFS.md

Possible addition following the Tuxera talk: whether the roadmap should carry an explicit storage and persistence workstream, including a power-interruption test profile.

# Action Items Review (from Jun 18)

- Ramon: follow up with Matt Weber on adding a Space workload example to the roadmap
- Group: evaluate FTRFS and ZFS for SGL inclusion, including licensing implications and hardware fault-tolerance baseline assumptions
- Ramon: chase remaining doc relicensing approvals (CC-BY-SA-4.0 -> CC-BY-4.0) from Matthias Schmitz and Celeste
- Roadmap: draft Minimal System Layer proposal, documenting what's in the build and why
- Roadmap: scope partition stress/analysis work using stress-ng
