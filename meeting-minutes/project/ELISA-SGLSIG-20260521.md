## ELISA Space Grade Linux Special Interests Group

The goal of the group is to advance space technology innovation and competitiveness by developing a common Linux distribution that can be used in space applications, ready for the challenges of deep space, often long lifespan robotic or human-based missions. The nature of space missions brings many challenges, from development to deployment there are multiple considerations that need to be considered. Furthermore this group is the initial step towards creating an ecosystem of supported platforms and a community that benefits from them, and also from the open source nature of the project.

# Announcements

## Foundation Update

SGL standalone LF project formation continues. Technical Charter finalized April 14; CONTRIBUTING.md and MAINTAINERS.md merged to meta-sgl (#50). Founding member outreach ongoing across NA, EU and Japan. If your organization wants to be part of the inaugural group, please reach out to Ramon at rroche@linuxfoundation.org.

## Other

- KP Labs (Marcin Drobik) also offered to present on ECSS compliance for Linux-based systems - propose scheduling for the June or July SIG meeting given today's CNES slot.

# Guest Presentation: CNES / KOSMOS Flight Software (30 min)

**Speaker:** Simon Corbin, Embedded Linux team, CNES (Flight Software Division, Toulouse)
**Deck:** SGL_SIG_May_CNES_KOSMOS.pdf

Topics:

1. **KOSMOS framework overview**
   - CNES generic flight software framework, ECSS-B qualified
   - Time and space partitioning on XNG hypervisor (Fentiss) + LithOS RTOS
   - Flight heritage: ANGELS, Eyesat, SWOT, JUICE (MAJIS), SVOM (ECLAIRs, MXT), MMX (IDEFIX, Rolbox), MERLIN, Kineis (x25), SWARM
2. **Why Linux? New use cases driving the need**
   - SESAM: Python-based AI for on-board telemetry anomaly detection
   - LORA: Lunar Operation Robotic Assistant (ROS-based)
   - Satellite swarms / constellations (inter-sat comms, OTA, cyber)
3. **How CNES plans to address it - 3 steps**
   - Step 1: Yocto-based Linux partition in KOSMOS using XNG BSP layer (relying on poky, and potentially SGL)
   - Step 2: Application Manager - "smartphone in orbit", dynamic app load
   - Step 3: Full Linux-based flight software (Merlin Kooshmanian PhD: multi-policy hierarchical scheduling for containerized space apps)
4. **Open challenges / where SGL can help**
   - Minimal Yocto distribution definition (what's "minimal", which configs, bloat avoidance)
   - Reliability tuning: systemd vs applicative services; when to use PREEMPT-RT
   - Filesystem choice under tight RAM (initramfs / ext4 / squashfs on NAND)
   - KAS for reproducibility
   - Custom layers: KOSMOS layer (PUS services 1/3/5/17/140, monitoring signals, app execution)
   - Isolation between distribution generation and application code development
   - Maintainability: project layout on GitHub/GitLab, delegating Yocto vs app work to different teams
   - Asks: "Are there NASA/ESA initiatives on Linux-for-space standards?" / European coordination angle

Discussion: where does SGL fit in CNES's Linux roadmap, and which of these challenges should the roadmap explicitly address?

# Technical Topics

## Roadmap Discussion (continued)

Carrying over from April 16. RFC thread still open on the mailing list. Use Simon's challenge list to stress-test the current priorities (Minimal System Layer, PREEMPT-RT characterization, KAS reproducibility, filesystem options).

Open follow-ups from last meeting:
- Boeing/AMD Xen functional safety + space workload example - status from Matthew Weber
- Minimal System Layer proposal draft
- stress-ng partition stress/analysis scope
- CI-to-hardware plan
