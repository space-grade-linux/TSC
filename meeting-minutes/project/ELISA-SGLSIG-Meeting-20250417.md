## ELISA Space Grade Linux Special Interests Group

The goal of the group is to advance space technology innovation and competitiveness by developing a common Linux distribution that can be used in space applications, ready for the challenges of deep space, often long lifespan robotic or human-based missions. The nature of space missions brings many challenges, from development to deployment there are multiple considerations that need to be considered. Furthermore this group is the initial step towards creating an ecosystem of supported platforms and a community that benefits from them, and also from the open source nature of the project.

# Technical Topics

## meta-sgl first pull request

From the group that submitted the PR:
> Distribution: Whatever is the LTS, right now Scarthgap
Hardware: QEMU + BeagleV-Fire
Name: SGL for now, we will bring this up with the larger group
> 
> We also agreed on multiple layers on the github repo following the AGL example, with meta-sgl-core being the one we will be focusing on initially
> 
> Lastly, we will be using kas for layer management.

https://github.com/elisa-tech/meta-sgl/pull/2

* repo vs kas?: kas ✅
* Hardware?: BeagleV-Fire / QEMU ✅
* Yocto release?: Scarthgap / two distro approach: tiny + systmd-based
  * tiny: minimal with bare minimum requirements (poky or poky-tiny)
  * systemd-based: more robust version (poky-altcfg)
* meta-sgl-core?:

**AGL systemd service management example**: https://docs.automotivelinux.org/en/salmon/#06_Component_Documentation/Application_Framework/01_Introduction/#service-management
